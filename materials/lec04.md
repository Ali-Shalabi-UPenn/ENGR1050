# Lecture 4: Plots, data cleanup and uniaxial extension data

Today we reviewed lists, loops and conditionals, introduced how to load modules and libraries, and showed how to use matplotlib (a useful library for generating plots). We then broke off into pairs to complete a coding exercise to get practice using our new tools in the context of data cleanup and data curation. After completing this exercise, you should be comfortable:

- Working with and manipulating lists of lists
- Creating a new list by looping over an old one
- Using for loops to perform elementwise operations on a list
- Using index slicing to grab subsets of lists
- Using matplotlib to generate simple plots

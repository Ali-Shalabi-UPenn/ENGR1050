# Lecture 5: Collecting data: functions, while loops, widgets and lab reports

In this lecture, we got some practice using lists and iterators (for/while loops) in order to collect data input from a user. We practiced using functions to encapsulated repeated tasks, and showed how to generate either a command prompt or a graphical user interface (GUI) to collect and plot (x,y) data.

# Lecture 3: Variables, Lists, If/For Loops and Baseball

Today we introduced the basics of Python variables, how to create and use lists, how to use for loops to iterate over lists, and how to use if statements to control the logical flow of programs. We concluded with an in-class exercise to demonstrate how to combine these ideas to analyze a simple dataset of baseball statistics. At the end of this lecture you should be able to explain:

- What is a variable? Strings, integers, floats and booleans
- What is a list? How to build them up.
- What is a for loop? How to use them to process a list.
- What is an if statement? How to use them to process each element of a list differently.

Refer to [the lecture's Jupyter notebook](notebooks/lec03.ipynb) for details.

The in-class assignment for the day is to be submited on [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1881448/assignments/13942478) by Friday 9/5.

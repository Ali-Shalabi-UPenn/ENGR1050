# Lecture 1: Introduction to Python

For each lecture, you will find links to external readings, resources, announcements, and other good stuff here.

In today's lecture, we worked through a Jupyter notebook and submitted an "in-class exercise" to understand how the canvas assignment system works. Submit by end of week.

Note that this was a **placeholder Jupyter notebook** illustrating what a random exercise will look like, and that the submission was to confirm you known how to use Canvas. There is no expectation that you can write code at that level (yet!).

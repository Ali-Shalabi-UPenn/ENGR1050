# Lecture 1: Introduction to Python

For each lecture, you will find links to external readings, resources, announcements, and other good stuff here.

In today's lecture, we worked through a Jupyter notebook and submitted an "in-class exercise" to understand how the canvas assignment system works. Submit by end of week.

## AI Policy
- Use of AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) is permitted for learning and exploration. Work submitted should be your own.
- Be extremely careful of falling for the common pitfall of overestimating your command of the material. Exams are designed to make sure you know material without help from a LLM.
- All submitted work must be your own. If you use AI-generated code or text, you must clearly cite the tool and describe how you used it.
- Direct copying of solutions from AI or the internet without understanding is considered academic dishonesty.
- If in doubt, ask the instructor for guidance on appropriate use of AI tools.
